# my-opensim-docs
This repo collects all the technical docs I am writing (to be published as a complete tutorial) covering all the steps needed to Self Host an OpenSim region server connected to the NeverWorld grid, running on a Digital Ocean VPS droplet... All sub tasks included, and hopefully written for folks with no prior DevOps experience to follow and successfully self-host their own regions in the same fashion for not too much money per month!  This configuration will provide a much better in-world experience for Avitars visiting your region than any setup hosted from a residential home computer/network... Starting out with the minimal resources _(mostly RAM because bandwidth and disk space on smaller VPS droplets is more than sufficient)_ to see how performance goes for a small region starting out...
