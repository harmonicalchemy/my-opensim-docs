# HAP My OpenSim Docs - README

This repository collects all the technical docs I am writing to be ultimately published as technical sections, or rather _"puzzles to solve - video game style"_ within a book titled **"My OpenSim Journey"**.  The Introduction to that book is complete and [can be read here](OpenSim-MetaWorlds/My-OpenSim-Journey/My-OpenSim-Journey.pdf).

The actual technical section located within **[`OpenSim-MetaWorlds/OpenSim-Grid-Docs`](OpenSim-MetaWorlds/OpenSim-Grid-Docs)**
contains a complete stand alone technical document _(apart from the book, without all the drama)_ because I have to wear my engineering hat while I go over all this to make sure everything is documented correctly and works, before putting it into a "story setting" when I am wearing my fiction writing hat...
 
The file: **[HAP-OpenSim-Region-Server-Build-Config-ALL.md](OpenSim-MetaWorlds/OpenSim-Grid-Docs/HAP-OpenSim-Region-Server-Build-Config-ALL.md)** serves as a complete tutorial covering all the steps needed to Self Host an OpenSim region server connected to the NeverWorld grid, running on a Digital Ocean VPS droplet... 

All required sub tasks are included within the above document. My goal is to ensure it has ultimately been written/revised for folks with no prior **DevOps** experience who will be able to follow it without a lot of hand-holding, to successfully self-host their very own NeverWorld test regions, and possibly get them running Live and officially connected to the grid! All for not so much money per month...


This configuration will provide a much better in-world experience for Avitars visiting your region than any setup hosted from a residential home computer/network... Starting out with the minimal resources for about $5/month, _(RAM, being the critical factor, because bandwidth and disk space even on the smallest VPS droplets is more than sufficient)_.

This is going to be a fun experiment, and I hope I can get a few of us to try it out soon! I am very interested in how our performance stats look after a few of us have regions linked up...
