To use this Book Project Skeleton (template) for your own projects, perform the following three steps:

1. *Clone a Copy of this File:* Put it where you normally organize your writing projects.  Place it within its own folder named after your intended project title...

2. *Copy/Clone ./media _(and all its contents)_:* To your new project's folder _(where you copied this file)_...  Any external documents or images referenced by your book project should be placed within this ./media/ directory... All of the external links, images, within the boilerplate examples may be used as examples for getting your own images, and external attachments linked properly...  This single ./media directory serves media and external attachments for all of the .org files contained within this .emacs.d/Docs/pub‚úéOps directory... Cloning any of the other .org files will also require copy/cloning the ./media directory relative to them...

3. *Start Writing Your Book:*  Change headings and structure to match your books outline Sections/Chapters/Scenes/ Plots, Characters, etc. Start doing the Tasks within the Tasks section... Have fun doing this...

The In-Buffer Settings and KEYWORDS specified above are configured to get this file looking good when exported as a Standard PDF file:  To make a PDF out of this file issue the following Emacs command:

     M-x org-latex-export-to-pdf

After AucTeX is done parsing/compiling etc., a new PDF by the name of New-Untitled-Book.pdf -and- New-Untitled-Book.tex will appear within the same directory as this file...  

Subsequent repeated calls to the above command will overwrite your existing New-Untitled-Book.pdf -and- New-Untitled-Book.tex files! 

Change the #+EXPORT_FILE_NAME: directive at the top of this file to "Your-Book's-Title.pdf" That will be the file name produced thence forward...

<2020-07-30 Thu> So far things are pretty basic PDF... We will get fancy with other formats later... I promice... I have to do all this documentation first!

Enjoy! - Alisha Awen

* üí° Scratchpad Refile:                               :noexport:Projects:@EA:
** ‚òû Start Here!

:README:
This Section is mainly to accommodate "seat-of-pants" writers (of which I have been accused of but I also crave the planning stuff).  I often come here for my [[https://projects.csail.mit.edu/gsb/old-archive/gsb-archive/gsb2000-02-11.html]["yak shaving"]] adventures...

Use this: "üí° Scratchpad Refile ‚òû Start Here!" section as a quick place to document ideas and inspirations as they come alone.  You can refile them later... (even if it is intended for elsewhere) Parallel universe? Sure... You got that covered. %^)

- Use this section to quickly capture inspired at-the-moment ideas While they are still fresh in mind.

- Come directly here:

  + Advance your cursor a few newlines below this README drawer on a fresh clean line with some extra space below it as well... (above any previously time stamped entries you may already have placed)... If this is the first time, get rid of the "Visisonar - Object" example entry below... That is only for the template to illustrate these instructions by example.

  + You are now at the top of the list, (a few lines below this README drawer). The time is the present. -and- You are all fired up with an idea to write about!

  + Enter a new timestamp with "C-c .", (that's: Press Ctrl-c, let go, and then type a Period .)  A date chooser panel will pop up...

  + Press ENTER to auto accept today's date and time.  A new timestamped line will appear with your cursor blinking on the right of it... There won't be any future entries above you... (maybe next decade? time travel?)

  + Advance your cursor a few more lines down to some fresh empty space -and- 

  + Start Typing Your Idea Like Mad! 

  + Don't stop and don't worry about formatting or organizing it until later, after all your inspiration has passed and you are ready to organize...

- After You are Done Writing:

  + Come back to the timestamp line where you first started... make sure the timestamp has at least one empty line above and below it.

  + Give the timestamp line a title to the right of the timestamp.

  + Make this timestamped line an outline heading with: "C-c ENTER" (that's Press Ctrl-c, let go and then press ENTER)
     (make sure this new heading has empty lines above and below it)

  + Adjust this new outline heading level with: M-‚ñ∑ (this will make it a child of ‚òû Start Here! heading above, rather than a sibling).

  + Adjust the space between your heading and your fantastic idea below it to one single blank line.

  + You can organize everything else later...  Don't scare away the muses! Get your story down now!

  + Then you may go out to play elsewhere little grasshopper... But come back later and organize things... OK? Don't create a swamp in here! And don't forget to take your bath tonight... ;-) 

  + Having done the simple steps above any time you get inspired, you will be able to tell your grand children.. "I got my first spark of an idea for that book back in Year, Month, Day, time, second" (50 years later!) Now that is being organized! LOL

*** <2020-06-07 Sun> Visisonar - Object from Asimov's Foundation Series

:README:
This is a dummy example of some crazy idea that you may have gotten at the spur of the moment, while you were doing something elsewhere within this project...  After you are done getting as much of the idea as you initally can then you can simply go back to what you were doing before the inspiration segue tore you away... you might want to schedule this as a todo item before leaving though...

Later when you are free you can come back to file this or place it where it belongs.  In the case of the note below it would probably go in a research folder of a Sci-Fi related project...
:END:

From Isaac Asimov's science fiction series 'Foundation', specifically the section of 'Foundation and Empire' entitled 'The Mule', the visisonar is considered a musical instrument.

Unlike most instruments, this one does not achieve its effect by using sonic effects but, instead, directly stimulates the listeners' mental well-being. The number of people and level of effect depends on the skill level of the player. As this was a device from the First Empire, there were not that many people around with any skill at all. However, the Mule's clown, Magnifico, had some skill with the instrument and was asked to play for select parties on the Foundation and for large groups of workers on Haven. This may not have been a good idea...
* üìñ Introduction:
** üìÑ Synopsis:

:README:
This section has been purposefully left blank for you to fill in...

Use this space to write the main synopsis of your work... You can write anything you want here but it is recommended to use the award winning "Snowflake Method" created by [[https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/][Randy Ingermanson]] of Ingermanson Communications, Inc.  These steps have been provided for you in the main "Tasks:" section...

- Go to the "‚è∞ Tasks:" section and do the: "üìÉ Synopsis Tasks:"


- After completing those tasks mark them "DONE" and place your resulting synopsis notes in here... You will be coming back here to consult these notes for many things as you promote and publish your book.

A hacker girl grows up all alone in the meta universe using her natural octopus wits to survive while developing mesh design super powers within a secret octopus hideout.  Her developing skills alone were not enough to fight off mesh pirates who eventually discover her hideout and steal everything she owns, leaving her at the end of a dark ally, in Second Life, in the rain, crying, and bleeding to death... but... then a (rather handsome) warrior, mentor, mesh master, appears out of nowhere, saves her life, nurses her back to health, and teaches her the way of the "light mesh".  

Everything seems to be going smoothly for a few years... Hacker Girl, (now known as SirenƒÉ has almost completed her training, but then one dark and stormy evening Sirena and her mentor are separated from each other after the evil dark mesh lord discovers their grid location and launches a brutal attack, killing her mentor, and leaving SirenƒÉ badly wounded.  SirenƒÉ managed to escape to an old hiding place to recover however....  Will she make a plan and come back later and face the evil mesh lord?  Will SirenƒÉ save the day for independent mesh designers everywhere?

Find out by reading this book... And also discover how SirenƒÉ learned how to Self Host  her own OpenSim Cyberworlds on disposable commodity Virtual Private Servers, running in fast data centres around the globe!  Now You too can break free of your shackles and no longer bow to the mercy of the mesh pirates.  Learn how to host your own regions within NeverWorld Grid!!!



** üìÑ About this Book:
This book serves as an official Harmonic Alchemy Productions (HAP) tutorial outlining all best practice steps needed to learn the basics, then follow directions while learning how to manually create a new virtual private server /(i.e., VPS - droplet)/ on [[https://m.do.co/c/449bba2e8a2d][*DigitalOcean*]].


The next "puzzle" for you to solve is how to provision your new droplet and get it ready for running a reasonably secure basic web-app or generic web-app skeleton, which you will have installed yourself /(provided you followed the steps)/ and have begun your own *DIY* test project on your own account at [[https://m.do.co/c/449bba2e8a2d][*DigitalOcean*]]  /(an inexpensive smaller test server setup)/ for beginning. btw, You can shut down your server when not needed so you won't get charged for that up-time... Keep your monthly bill less than $5.  But possibly host at least One reasonably performing region on NeverWorld grid with one or two visitors hanging out there... think about that eh? for less than five bucks!


The server you build, /(we build together)/ will be ready for any purpose: (e.g., client or personal, business or pleasure, git server, web tool, mail server, doc-sever, notes server, personal cloud, wiki, Wordpress, OpenSim server, or most any other internet server related process.). 


*/The main purpose of this book is to teach NeverWorld Grid Designers how to become Self Hosting DevOps System Admins, learning step by step, puzzle by puzzle, game level by game level, stylized as a classic tale about one hacker girl's Hero's Journey into the building and managing of a 100% self hosted OpenSim region server... (written as an Alice in Wonderland sci-fi fantasy novel)/*


Yes... you read that correctly!  Rather than write yet another dry manual that only geeks can tolerate, I decided to let my fiction pen loose and write this up as a classic "Hero's Journey" with real characters.. Characters you will identify with immediately... Maybe you know some of them already living in your regions!


Trying to marry these two dynamically opposed concepts is going to take a lot of digging and plotting... lol... But we will grow a beautiful garden here... I am sure of it... The world needs online communities more than ever now that these nasty viruses are out there plaguing us IRL... We can build beautiful vistas with clear blue skies here!  The sky's the limit too! Hooray!!!  Not to hide from the virus, but to team up here in our bunkers and come up with a real-world solution... OK?  We got our grid jedi training to do now... Lets get on it...


For now we are using [[https://m.do.co/c/449bba2e8a2d][*DigitalOcean*]].  I recommend at least starting with that as I currently use them for all my servers now.  There may be other providers who offer services for less, and later I will investigate those options as it is important to have many options when it comes to hosting companies...


This tutorial assumes you have access to a Linux/BSD/or other unix platform as your local DevOps / SysAdmin machine which you will be using to connect securely via SSH on the command line (within a terminal app) in order to create and manage your remote servers within the data centres where they are hosted...  


If your normal user platform is Windows I cannot help you much with that.  I have been a unix/Linux/BSD/Mac OS person for over 15 years, (after leaving IBM to start my own company) so my Windows knowledge is vastly limited.  I do know there is Cygwin: https://www.cygwin.com/ and if you install that on your windows box, you should be able to do most of the things within this tutorial... But I cannot really help beyond that... I need a windows/unix wizard to step up and help out here... I know that Microsoft has made lots of changes as of late... Thanks!


If you are completely new to the unix command line... Take a look at this great tutorial: https://www.openbookproject.net/tutorials/getdown/unix/lesson1.html


Depending on your platform, you may need to install and/or configure your systems "unix Terminal" application which you will use to practice the commands etc. from the above tutorial...  Having this basic unix command line knowledge under your belt will help you tremendously while following the steps outlined in this tutorial...


In addition to a Terminal Application, you also need a Text Editor... Not a word processor, but a true coder's text editor, (like Vi or Emacs which are the grandparents of all the rest)...


I use Emacs which is not only a text editor but also the gateway app to a world (a secret cult) of computer science wizards who are able to make their machines do amazing things without ever touching a mouse!  Amazing things that most GUI apps never dreamed of being able to do!  The mainstream has suppressed your knowledge of the command line... You could become a hacker!  OMG!  No don't let them have that kind of power... (sorry I got carried away there... lol)...


Enough introduction already.. Lets get on with this Self Hosting 101 course...

# Begin Chapter:

** NEW üìÑ Episode: unixFU Basics

** ACTIVE üìÑ Episode: Self Hosting 101
*** Step One: Create DigitalOcean Account 

First thing to do is open an account with Digital Ocean... This is a free account starting out and you are not charged for setting it up...

If you don't yet have a Digital Ocean account, sign up using my affiliate link here:

https://m.do.co/c/449bba2e8a2d

By clicking the link above both You and I will get credit from Digital Ocean.  You will get $10 credit after signing in... (about 2 months worth of server time on a basic VPS)... btw, you do not incur any fees or charges until you actually fire up your first VPS droplet.  Fees are based on metered time your droplet is running, not the resources it uses which are guaranteed up to the limits stated on the droplet package you choose. If you shut down your machine that metered charge/minute goes way down...

After signing up with your account, you will be given an affiliate link just like the one above...  With your affiliate link, you will receive a bonus when a friend or referral  sign's up using your referral link.  (standard marketing games eh? lol) Use your affiliate link to pay it forward...

If you are doing this job for a client, or someone else paying the bill?  Fantastic! First sign up for a Free Digital Ocean Account yourself... Then ask your client to get an account with DigitalOcean using your affiliate link...  Once they have their account set up, help them create a team account. (easy instructions on Digital Ocean website) Have them set you up as System Admin (i.e., the tech person to manage VPS servers etc.) 

Your client will be the owner of their own Digital Ocean account, and you are an outside 3rd party invited (given sysAdmin access) to manage servers on that account...  This keeps business between you and the hosting company separate from you and your client and also gives them full control over final decisions about their account...  Better more flexible arrangement for all parties IMHO.

Once you get you access credentials for working in a client's DO account, it would be wise to store your account access credentials in a strong encrypted password-vault like KeePassXC https://keepassxc.org/ (under your client's name). 

Destroy any non secure copies of that information elsewhere...  You are responsible for things you don't own...  Protect those things as if they belonged to your Mother! After that you are ready to log into their new account to manage VPS droplets for them...


*** Step Two: Install Dev Tools and Learn unix command line

For this step you need to install an X Windows compliant Terminal App.  If you are already using Linux you are all set with several choices from the package mangers as well as the default Terminal package that comes already installed on your particular flavor of Linux..  On Fedora I use the Xfce Terminal which gets installed using Fedora Linux standard DNF package manager.  on Debian you can also install this same terminal using Debian's APT package manager...  On Mac OS, use ITerm2 (awesome open-source terminal and all you ever need on a Mac)...

If you use Windows, in the old days, we used putty but that must for sure have changed by now in 2020...  I cannot help with Windows platforms and need someone to step up here and help me out... Thanks!

If you are a total newbee and have no idea what I am talking about, first of all... all of the tools/package things mentioned above are all things done on the command line... Not in a GUI app running in a fancy window with buttons, menus, etc.  

You need to learn how to use the unix command line which is fairly universal across all systems!  GUI apps are all different and can be quite confusing... At least to an old dog like me who has been comfortable using the command line with total wizard power for over 25 years!!!  

You too will become a wizard once you learn how to break free of your mouse and touch pad shackles... Power on the command line is unlimited... Power within a GUI is limited to the GUI designer's whims...  Get it now? Spread the word... This is secret geek wizard knowledge... 

Wait till I start talking about the Emacs Text Editor / parallel universe where the real hackers live! OMG! btw, as you may have guessed by now... The word "hacker" in my dictionary is a good thing... "Someone who can figure out how to do things with out consulting docs... Someone good at fixing bugs when everyone else fails..." etc. etc. etc... 

Not someone who criminally breaks into software systems... I call those people "Crackers" enough said about that...

** üí° Reference Notes:

Add any references here that are important to record while you are writing this book...

** ‚éò Procedures to incorporate into book: 

*** Create new SSH Keys:

This is a new droplet and it‚Äôs a good idea to use different SSH keys for access...

*** Create a new VPS Droplet:

Log into your Digital Ocean account and do these steps:

1. Choose the latest LTS version of Ubuntu...

2. Choose Data Center Region - Choose the best data center location for this installation... (don‚Äôt bother with block storage option if you don‚Äôt need it)

3. Enable IPv6 & Monitoring: Under: ‚ÄúSelect additional options‚Äù check the boxes next to ‚ÄúIPv6‚Äù & ‚ÄúMonitoring‚Äù (fyi: don‚Äôt use the IPv6 address to create host records on the DNS)

4. Import SSH Public Key: Before Finalizing the creation of your new VPS droplet import the SSH key you want to use for access (or use one you already uploaded if it‚Äôs your account).

5. Use a Proper Host Name: Under the Finalize and Create section, choose 1 droplet, and choose a proper host name for it: (e.g., <vps1.example.com>) where "example.com" is replaced by the domain used to create the host record for this droplet. (not necessarily the same domain used for your OpenSim regions etc. but in most cases that may be a good idea).  If there already is a vps1 sub domain record on your domain, make your new sub domain record: vps2. You would have to do this if you are creating more than one droplet at this time... (i.e., vps1, vps2, vps3, ...)  

6. Finalize droplet creation: Click the Long Green Create Button at the bottom of the form now... After the new DO VPS droplet is created, (with the SSH key option above) you will NOT receive a root password sent via email to MWM Support. It will use your SSH key to validate you instead. Copy the droplet‚Äôs IP address for the next step...

*** Create Sub Domain Host Record for your new VPS droplet:

Note: you won‚Äôt be able to create a host record for this sub domain until you get it‚Äôs IP address after the droplet is created (from above steps). Then you can go create that sub domain record as your immediate next step:

1. As soon as Digital completes your droplet and you have it‚Äôs IP address, this is your immediate next step... Get this server into the domain system by adding it‚Äôs host record to the domain‚Äôs DNS as an ‚ÄúA‚Äù record. Do that in your Intellegent.Domains account... (or the domain account that your client uses)

*** Log in to your VPS (first time only as root):

Go to your shell console window and log in as root via SSH:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash

ssh root@VPS1.your-domain.com 

#+END_SRC

Now you are connected as root on your spiffy new VPS. Before doing anything else on this brand new Ubuntu 16.04 machine (just out of box) make sure you are running the latest version of the distro:
root@vps2:~# apt update
root@vps2:~# apt dist-upgrade

- Other people wishing to self host their own OpenSim regions within a fast data centre using in-expensive VPS tech, will be attracted to this subject.  I recently joined NeverWorld grid and have made some friends there already... Everyone I have chatted with so far are excited that I am taking on this project!  So here goes....

After completing above, follow the steps below... 

when you are done with these Synopsis tasks, you will have completed half the battle of writing your novel! The other half is getting to know your characters... Plots and chapters will flow from that effortlessly...

Take an hour and write a one-sentence summary of your novel:   
   
Something like this:

    "A gourmet chef from Boston acedentally falls into a parallel world, almost destroyed by an arch enemy he did not even know he had, then he discovers he is immortal and meets-re-discovers his ancient soul mate of eons. Together they save the universe after all else fails!"

OK I know... I cheated. The second sentence is a stinger. It needs to stand alone... I often buck the rules... lol

The sentence you end up writing above will serve you forever as a ten-second selling tool. This exercise defines the big picture illustrated by the first simple triangle in the snowflake diagram (as explained to Goldilocks and classmates by Baby Bear in chapter 4 of Randy Ingermanson's book: "How to Write a Novel Using the Snowflake Method"

****** Here are some tips:

- Shorter is better. Try for fewer than 15 words.

- No character names, please! Better to say "a handicapped trapeze artist" than "Jane Doe".

- Tie together the big picture and the personal picture. Which character has the most to lose in this story? Now tell me what he or she wants to win.

- Read the one-line blurbs on the New York Times Bestseller list to learn how to do this. Writing a one-sentence description is an art form. If you become a master at this marketing firms will want you madly!

- Check out [[yt:feD-dImM4a8][LEGO Star Wars: The Last Jedi in 60 Seconds]] (and other 60 second movies like it) for a completely different audio/visual parallel to this literary concept...

***** My Summary:

A hacker girl grows up all alone in the meta universe using her natural octopus wits to survive while developing mesh design super powers within a secret octopus hideout.  Her developing skills alone were not enough to fight off mesh pirates who eventually discover her hideout and steal everything she owns, leaving her at the end of a dark ally, in Second Life, in the rain, crying, and bleeding to death... but... then a (rather handsome) warrior, mentor, mesh master, appears out of nowhere, saves her life, nurses her back to health, and teaches her the way of the "light mesh".  

Everything seems to be going smoothly for a few years, and Sirena has almost completed her training, but then one dark and stormy evening Sirena and her mentor are separated after the evil dark mesh lord discovers their grid location and launches and attack, killing her mentor, and leaving her badly wounded.  Sirena managed to escape to an old hiding place to recover however....  Will she make a plan and come back later and face the evil mesh lord?  Will Sirena save the day for independent mesh designers everywhere?

Find out by reading this book... And also discover how Sirena learned how to Self Host  her own OpenSim Cyberworlds on disposable commodity Virtual Private Servers, running in fast data centres around the globe!  Now You can to break free of your shackles and no longer bow to the mercy of the mesh pirates.  Learn how to host your own regions within NeverWorld Grid!!! ;-)


**** ACTIVE Step Two - Expand Summary to Paragraph
:LOGBOOK:
- State "NEXT"       from "DONE"       [2020-10-15 Thu 16:57]

:END:

Take another hour and expand your sentence from step one into a full paragraph describing the story setup, major disasters, and ending of the novel.

This step defines the second stage of the snowflake model... as illustrated by further trisections of the triangle producing the snowflake diagram (as explained to Goldilocks and classmates by Baby Bear in chapter 5, "The Importance of being Disastrous" in Randy Ingermanson's book: "How to Write a Novel Using the Snowflake Method"

For this step, visualize the story as having "three disasters plus an ending". Each of the disasters takes a quarter of the book to develop and the ending takes the final quarter. 

No one claims this to be an absolute ideal structure, but it's the one that Randy Ingermanson uses, and it has a strong basis in psychology.

If you believe in the Three-Act structure, then:

- The first disaster would correspond to the end of Act 1.

- The second disaster would be the mid-point of Act 2.

- The third disaster would come at the end of Act 2, and force Act 3,

- Act 4 wraps everything up.

***** ACTIVE Make 5 Sentences:

1. Exposition: 

:README:
This sentence's purpose is to paint the story setting, backdrop and mention leading characters within a descriptive role... The mood is set here briefly, dripping with consentrated visions of expectation!
:END:

  + A hacker girl named SirenƒÉ discovers the wonders, adventures, and dangers of "the meta universe". Being part octopus with excellent design skills she feels quite at home and learns how to build a beautiful wonderland for herself in Second Life...  After searching and searching for others who might share her vision of discovery within this new world with the freedom to build and share alike within a creative community, she instead encounters a sea of mean hungry mesh sharks...

2. Act One - First Disaster Summary:

:README:
The first disaster emerges out of circumstance. This is the key event that motivates our lead character (hero) to find a remedy.  This disaster must hit home to our readers as well, inspiring them along side our hero as faithful evangelists... 
:END:


  +  with the art of deception, which has helped her for years to evade dangerous mesh sharks, who would otherwise steal everyting she owns and leave her helpless, alone, torn to bits, and in critical health, even though her powers of mesh body regeneration are amazing to say the least!





3. First Half of Act Two - Second Disaster Summary:

:README:
The second disaster is the result of our budding hero's attempt to "fix things" after the first disaster in Act One. But things keep getting worse, not better.  As a result, our hero experiences an epiphany, realizing the errors of her ways, and resolves to do things the correct way from that moment on... (the music changes, new hope emerges)
:END:

   + Handsome Warrior Mentor finds SirenƒÉ half dead at the end of a dark Second Life alley, in the rain... picks her up and teleports her to his secret outpost in a new land called OSGrid.  After she regains her health, he teaches SirenƒÉ the way of the "Light Mesh"...

   + For years, SirenƒÉ practices and learns the Light Mesh warrior ways, and in the process falls deeply in love with her warrior master, believing together they will save the metaverse!

   + But then, unexpectedly, her training is cut short and she looses the love of her life in the process...

4. Second Half of Act Two - Third Disaster & Standoff Summary:

:README:
The last half of Act 2 is the standoff between your hero and villain or obstacle... Here is where your hero's new resolve to doing the right thing begins to pay off.  However this act ends with the third disaster...  Act 3 will determine the final outcome.
:END:

5. Act 3 Summary: (conclusion)

:README:
This is where it all previous conflicts are finally resolved, one way or the other... Whether or not the lead character (hero) whatever succeeds or fails.  The story once resolved ends as a comedy, tragedy, or mellowdrama.  you decide on that...
:END:

***** NEXT Using Your One-Paragraph Summary:

A hacker girl discovers the meta universe, discovers she has some skills but not enough to fight off mesh pirates who steal everything she owns, leaving her at the end of a dark ally, in Second Life, in the rain, crying, and bleeding to death... but... then a (rather handsome) warrior mentor mesh master appears out of nowhere, saves her life, nurses her back to health, and teaches her the way of the "light mesh", only to be separated after the evil dark mesh lord discovers their grid location and launches and attack, killing her mentor, and leaving her badly wounded, but she managed to escape to make a plan and come back later to save the day...  (teaching others how to do the same, self hosting their own OpenSim cyberworlds)... 



You will be using this paragraph in your proposals. It is only for your agents etc.  Not for your readers who need to be kept in the dark about how the story develops before reading the book! Spoilers!

However, Some of this paragraph (written with parts pourposefully left out or with questions put in place) may end up back-cover copy for your book's promotion.

**** NEXT Step Three - Expand Paragraph to Synopsis:
:LOGBOOK:
- State "NEXT"       from "DONE"       [2020-10-15 Thu 16:57]
- State "DONE"       from "NEW"        [2020-07-04 Sat 15:54]

- State "DONE"       from "ACTIVE"     [2020-06-08 Mon 11:36]
:END:

Take several hours and expand each sentence of your summary paragraph into a full paragraph. All but the last paragraph should end in a disaster. The final paragraph is the final conclusion to those disasters bringing your book to a close.

You can employ the snowflake method at finer levels here... Breaking each paragraph into mini disasters or turning points within the main disaster, etc.

By this stage, you should have a good idea of the large-scale structure of your novel, and you have only spent a day or two, or at most, a week or two, but all that time will not have been wasted! You will now have a good idea if there are problems with your story. This is good knowledge to have now, rather than after investing 500 hours in a rambling first draft.

At the end of this exercise, you will have a nice one-page skeleton of your novel. It's fine if your skeleton does not fit all on one single-spaced page as long as it does not go beyond that... 

Your process now is to grow these ideas as chapters of your story. You are expanding the conflict. You have a synopsis suitable for a proposal, and you are well on your way to doing extended promotion...

Some of these Character tasks are based on the Snowflake Method as outlined in Randy Ingermanson's book: [[https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/]["How to Write a Novel Using the Snowflake Method"]].  Other tasks are based on concepts outlined within the book: [[https://www.kmweiland.com/wp-content/uploads/crafting-unforgettable-characters.pdf]["Crafting Unforgettable Characters" by; K.M. Weiland]]... The second book is a free download from: [[https://www.kmweiland.com/][K.M. Weilands Website]] where you can find other great books and writers resources... 

Much of what you will be filling in below is based on the above two books but no more instruction is given here as to the why or how... Only the dry forms are included here to make it convenient for you to complete this process...  You are strongly encouraged to purchase and read the above two books so that you will have a deeper understanding while you do this process...

The tasks within this section will be used to produce a *"Character Bible"* for each character in your story.

A character bible is the private lifetime personell file of that character...  Containing scrapbook items of importance throughout the character's life...  There is a new TV show on Amazon called: "Hanna" where this concept has been illustrated perfectly! In this CIA black ops thriller, Babies DNA are enhanced with wolf genes to make them grow up into super soldiers...  When they get deployed (looking as normal youths in high school, they each get a scrap-book containing all of their *"character's"* vital details.  There are pictures of family, best friends, past events, etc.  Their photo is on the front cover...

All of it is fake, but as these secret CIA teens carry out roll play _(within their fake role as normal high school students)_, they begin to believe more and more that they actually "are" who their profiles say they are and not trained CIA agents anymore!  This TV series illustrates the power of getting immersed emphatically with your characters!

Our character is on a rant, talking all about herself..., always bringing the subject back to personal perspective and personal truths. Soap Box time!

Hi! My name is Huckleberry Finn... you can call me "Huck" for short if you like...  Don't pay no attention to anything that famous man behind the curtain may have said about me... That man Samuel Langhorne Clemens, who calls himself Mark Twain... He may know some things about me but he ain't never walked in my shoes!  That's for sure!  Rich author riverboat caption and all... Let me tell you a few things he don't know about me!

For instance... Yadda yadda yadda...  Folks may call me a vagabond, but they don't know the truth of my story... If they knew about the time I had to... blah, blah, blah, ... They would change their minds and see me in a completely different light...  etc...

- Change the name of your copied template to a specific title needed to fit in with your project's story-structure...  In the case of Logs or Tasks, you probably will keep those titles as they are universal... but you may wish to further qualify them by adding a prefixed category word.

- Use this space to add time stamped log note entries for any pourpose you may need...

- To create a time stamped entry, use key command:

   + "C-c ."

   + Make your new entry an outline sub-heading of a Log section heading (as above but, wherever else you may need a collection of log entries).

- Keep your Log Entries in Decending Chronological Order.
   (i.e., put your newest entries on top)

This serves as a replacement for my Scrivener planning Logs /(Currently implemented as markdown files outside of Scrivener)/... Each Org-based Writing project will have one or more of these logs right inside of it close to the things the logs are actually about...  No more fumbling and guessing which log was I useing for what? Now, not only can I find them, I can make them into tasks, TODOS, and prioritize them to boot! Consider this my new official general template for logs going forward... Onward we row mates... Over the log jam!

**** üìÉ Summary:

:README:
This section is the executive summary (abstract) of a longer full story chapter within your book.  Stories like the Finnegan Series are fully invested on not one but many Interstellar Nations!  Your mileage may vary... %^)

You need to incorporate all the results of your research here in a similar way that Isaac Asimov wrote chapters undergoing many iterations over time about the Galactic Empire in his Foundation Series... 

This abstract, is a short historical and present summary only... It should include the major goals, motivations... who they‚Äôre at war with, etc. i.e., It should include the news headlines, and ledelines...  but not the full story... Results of your research below this summary should be as rich and detailed as you can make it... (but also indexed!)

I learned about this Snowflake Idea several years ago when I was first learning how to use the structure to build my Scrivener Projects starting out on a Macbook Pro 2011 model... 

# This Emacs Org Mode based Book Publishing project has been initially modelled upon my Scrivener Project but it will soon outgrow more and do much more than Scrivener could ever dream of!  I am sure of it! I have already discovered much. The Learning curve is levelling off finally!  Writing this now in my fancy Emacs buffer specifically designed for distraction free writing mode is a dream! All my edits are made very close to the typewriter home row!  No reaching for any mice or hard to reach keys while the stream of consciousness flows!  Much of that typing ease is thanks to the detailed and structured eLisp programming work of Xah Lee!  OMG! You did a ton of great things!  No Troll in my book! You are the Knight in Armour for the weak of tendons! Fantastic! Thanks Dude!

Everyone comes from somewhere.  People just don‚Äôt up and appear on islands and such.  I mean, even Native Americans walked across a land bridge way back in the day. Europeans came from Romans and Greeks and Celts and Gauls and more.  Very few people bother to look at this aspect of world-building, and they really should.  Even if a civilization has been around for two thousand years and are elven dragon riders, they came from somewhere.  Even if their mythology says they crawled out of the earth: they came from somewhere.  Examine it here in this space!

This template section contains a few example Back Story Plots which you can copy/clone into the "Back Story Plots:" sub-section of your main "Book:" section as needed for repourposing.

- It's a good idea to keep things organized (based on evolving existing and new emerging chapters within your book). The following tips will help you:

    + Keep your outline sub-headings timestamped below.

    + Keep track of your plot summaries by adding "GTD TODO" keywords.

    + Prioritize the plot summaries as well if needed. 

The above will help you get better organized about how your book is developing, what areas need the most work, etc.  Most importantly, this will help prevent you from making any grave mistakes causing any contradictions within your story later... (unless that was your intention "Alfred Hitchcock")... In any case you will be better informed by keeping all your plot tasks here where you can see them and resolve them quickly...

- Use the forms below when you need to make new Back Story Plots... Change the heading and content with the real "Back Story Plot" content for your book...
